# nextRACI — who's allowed to do what, and who's accountable, on a team of humans and AI agents

> When an AI agent does something on your team — ships code, sends a message,
> spends money — and no human pressed the button, **who is accountable?**
> nextRACI is one plain-language file that answers that up front, for every kind
> of action: who may do it, who signs off, and who owns the outcome.

For decades, teams have used **RACI** — a simple chart of who is *Responsible,
Accountable, Consulted, and Informed* for each kind of work. RACI quietly assumes
a person starts every task. AI agents break that assumption: they can act on
their own, but someone human must still answer for what they do.

**nextRACI brings RACI into the age of AI agents.** You write one file — a
*charter* — that lists, for each type of action on your team:

- who **does** it (Responsible),
- who is **accountable** (exactly one person or role),
- who must be **consulted** or kept **informed**,
- who has to **approve** it first, and
- what happens if the one who should act is **unavailable**.

A built-in checker reads the charter and flags the gaps before they bite: an
action with no one accountable, two people who both think they're in charge, or
an approval step that could quietly stall forever.

```bash
pip install nextraci
nextraci validate examples/sprout/charter.yaml
```

## What nextRACI is (and isn't) yet

**Today, nextRACI helps you write the charter and checks that it holds together.**
You get:

- a clear format for the charter file,
- an automatic checker that catches gaps, conflicts, and approval steps that could
  deadlock,
- a worked example and a blank template to start from.

**nextRACI does not run your team — yet.** It doesn't (today) intercept actions or
enforce approvals at the moment they happen. Tools like LangGraph, CrewAI, and
HumanLayer already handle *running* agents and pausing them for sign-off. nextRACI
sits one level up and answers what they don't: *on this specific team, who is
allowed to do what, and who breaks a tie.* Turning the charter into live, enforced
approvals is the next milestone on the roadmap — not a claim about today.

## The gap we fill

Today, RACI is mostly applied at the *governance* level — the boardroom and
compliance question of "who answers for the AI system as a whole" (the concern
behind standards like ISO/IEC 42001 and the EU AI Act). What's missing is the
*operating* level: a precise, machine-checkable charter for the day-to-day, where
the AI agents themselves hold real roles and the rules can be verified by a tool
instead of living in a slide deck. That everyday accountability — for the exact
moment an agent acts on its own — is what nextRACI covers.

## The core model (three independent questions)

Most "who does what" confusion comes from mixing up three different questions.
nextRACI keeps them separate:

| Question        | What it asks                      | Example |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| **Function**    | What do you *do*?                 | Orchestrate, Build, Advise, Investigate, Review, Watch |
| **Permission**  | What may you *touch*?             | `edit_code`, `merge`, `deploy`, `spend`, … granted **or explicitly denied** |
| **Authority**   | Whose call *wins* in a conflict?  | In v0.1, expressed via each action's `accountable` |

The proof they're separate: a **domain expert can be _accountable_ for a fact,
_denied_ the right to touch code, yet able to _block_ a merge on correctness
grounds** — all at once, none implying the others.

### Roles are defined once; members are assigned

You don't rewrite the rules for every agent. Define a small **set of roles**
(orchestrator, engineer, domain expert, researcher, reviewer, monitor) once, then
*assign* humans and agents to them. Adding an agent is a one-line appointment, not
a new rulebook.

### One accountable per action — no gaps, no turf wars

List the **types of action** in your project (not individual tasks), and require
each to have exactly one accountable role. Nobody accountable = a gap; two people
accountable = a turf war. The checker catches both.

### Escape hatches so the rules never deadlock

People aren't always online — and neither are agents. So every approval step must
say what happens on timeout (`block`, `escalate to someone`, or, only for
explicitly low-risk actions, `proceed`), and must have a `break_glass` emergency
path. Any blocked-but-confident actor gets a `suggestion_route` so their input
isn't silently dropped. `proceed` on timeout is a guarded opt-in — allowed only on
an action explicitly marked low-risk — so "low risk" can never become a quiet
backdoor for an agent to act unsupervised.

## The checker (v0.1)

| Rule | Checks |
|------|--------|
| **R1** | single accountable — every action type has exactly one `accountable` |
| **R2** | coverage — no unused permissions; no action uses an undeclared permission |
| **R3** | no contradiction — no role both grants and denies the same permission |
| **R4** | gate completeness — every approval step has a timeout rule + emergency path; every blocking `deny` has a `suggestion_route` |
| **R5** | low-risk gating — `proceed` on timeout only on an action marked low-risk |
| **R6** | acyclic authority — **planned** (v0.2): confirm the "who outranks whom" map has no impossible loops |

## CLI

```bash
nextraci validate <charter.yaml>                 # parse + check, with a per-rule report
nextraci compile --target humanlayer <charter>   # placeholder in v0.1
nextraci compile --target langgraph  <charter>   # placeholder in v0.1
```

## Roadmap

- **v0.1 — write it and check it.** The charter format, the checker (R1–R5), the
  Sprout example, and a template. ← you are here
- **v0.2 — first live connector + authority map.** A working HumanLayer connector
  that turns a charter into real approval gates, plus a team-wide "who outranks
  whom" map and a check that it has no impossible loops.
- **v0.3 — LangGraph connector** + a small web view that renders the chart so
  non-engineers can read it.
- **v0.4 — `nextraci lint --explain`** that names each gap or conflict in plain
  language and suggests a fix.
